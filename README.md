## Software Engineer :
- Software Engineering is a process . I think this the most Important thing that I learned until this moment . Build a software is complex process needs a lot of thinking and design . without the right system design you are going to loose time of business focus .

## Writer :

I believe as Jordan Peterson use to said that writing is a high level skill it is push you to think more . picking the right words the right description is not an easy thing . 

## Me and IT : 
- for me I believe that software engineering is a way of improving other domains . the great software engineers are those who use IT to improve other domains "DDD" and make others people lives easier . But the Real Software Engineers are those who Improve the IT world . because they love Computers instead of money those People who have a high abstract vision . I am a Boy in the middle of this way
